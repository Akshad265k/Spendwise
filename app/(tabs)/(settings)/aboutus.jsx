        We are a group of passionate college students from IIIT Pune who believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems. Our journey started with a shared vision to create something impactful during our academic journey.

As budding engineers and innovators, we combined our skills, ideas, and creativity to build this app. It reflects not just our technical knowledge but also our determination to push boundaries and bring a meaningful solution to life.

This app represents our commitment to innovation, teamwork, and our ambition to make a difference. Thank you for being part of our journeyâ€”we hope you love using it as much as we enjoyed creating it!
